# Branch Protection & GitHub Actions Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Branch: `updates`
- Created a new branch called `updates` to preserve all current work
- All validator code and Docker security improvements are on this branch
- Safe to work on without affecting master

### 2. Updated Auto-Merge Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`

**Changes**:
- Renamed from "Auto-merge" to "Auto-approve" 
- Changed from auto-merging to auto-approving PRs
- Removed `contents: write` permission (now only has `pull-requests: write`)
- Adds approval comment to PRs that pass security checks
- Dependabot PRs will now require manual merge after approval

**Why**: With branch protection enabled, direct merges to master are blocked. This workflow now approves safe PRs but leaves the final merge to maintainers.

### 3. Updated Build and Scan Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/build-and-scan.yml`

**Changes**:
- Added explicit check: only push Docker images from master branch
- Will not push from feature branches or PRs
- Added condition: `github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'`

**Why**: Prevents accidental image pushes from non-master branches, ensuring only merged code is published.

### 4. Updated Dependabot Configuration
**File**: `.github/dependabot.yml`

**Changes**:
- Explicitly set `target-branch: "master"` for all ecosystems
- Added clarifying comments about branch protection

**Why**: Makes it clear that Dependabot creates PRs against master, but branch protection rules prevent auto-merge.

## Current Workflow Permissions Audit

### ✅ Safe Workflows (Read-only)
- **CodeQL Security Scan**: `contents: read`, `security-events: write`
- **Docker Security Scan**: `contents: read`, `security-events: write`
- **Python Security Scan**: `contents: read`, `security-events: write`
- **Dependency Review**: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`
- **CodeRabbit**: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`

### ⚠️ Controlled Workflows
- **Auto-approve**: `pull-requests: write` only (no content write)
- **Build and Scan**: `contents: read`, `packages: write` (for Docker registry only)

## Branch Protection Best Practices

Recommended settings for `master` branch:

1. **Require pull request reviews before merging**
   - Require at least 1 approval
   - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed

2. **Require status checks to pass**
   - CodeQL Security Scan
   - Docker Security Scan
   - Build and Scan

3. **Require conversation resolution before merging**

4. **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**

5. **Restrict who can push to matching branches**
   - Only allow repository administrators

## How It Works Now

1. **Dependabot Updates**:
   - Dependabot creates PR → Workflows run tests/scans → Auto-approve if safe → **Manual merge required**

2. **Feature Branches** (like `updates`):
   - Create branch → Make changes → Create PR → Tests run → Review → **Manual merge required**

3. **After Merge to Master**:
   - Build workflow runs
   - Docker image pushed to GHCR
   - Security scans upload results to Security tab
   - No automatic commits back to master

## Next Steps

1. Push the `updates` branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add data validator and update GitHub Actions for branch protection"
   git push -u origin updates
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request from `updates` to `master`

3. Review the PR, ensure all checks pass

4. Manually merge when ready
