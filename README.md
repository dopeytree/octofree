# üêô octofree

Never miss Octopus free electricity again! 
*Saving Sessions* are frequent during high winds. Usually octopus send an email about 48hours before hand. 
We then forget.
Hence octofree. 

This script scans the website https://octopus.energy/free-electricity/ for the next seshion date & time then sends a Discord webhook notification to you.

## Virtual Environment

This project uses a Python virtual environment located in the `.venv` folder.

To activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux, zsh):

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate:

```sh
deactivate
```

If you need to create the virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```
